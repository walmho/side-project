This game uses pygame

As of right now, I'm thinking of making it a clicker game, but adding more strategy to it, such as having
raids on your "village" or "bank" or whatever, making you have to buy defenses that do different things, but have
impacts on your economy as well. The goal would be to succesfully defend against the attacks and get the most
money possible?
